# Personal Profile

This is the repository of my personal profile. 
The profile page is built using html, javascript and css. 
Within this repository, there are:

  + a folder 'images' which contains all the images used.
  + index.html implements the features of the site
  + styles.css contains the style design for the html site.
  + src.js contains javascript code implementing the logic of the site.

My idea is that I try to develop a single page site where the user hits next or prev to read more information about me (this ends up being like Powerpoint slides :D). The images of the face with universe inside implies an internal world and so tries to convey the theme of the world around me (the inside world) or you can intepret the symbols whatever you like :). I hope you find it both informative and enjoyable!

**Side note:**
This site is developed to a certain level of completion but it is, of course, not developed to perfection yet. There are still features that can be made better, such as annimation, backgrounds, colors, etc. As this is my first ever html project, please excuse me for that (and things will hopefully improve in the future). 
Also, another note around this site is that it should be used on a computer/desktop/laptop which has large enough screen to cover my images. (if the site is opened on a mobile phone, it is likely that the image and text are all totally shifted rightwards). Again, this is a problem and I will try to fix this soon.

Finally, as you may have already deduced, the link to the hosted site is: 
https://hoang-dang173.github.io/profile-page/ 

The screenshot below illustrates a part of it and how it is expected to look like:

Let me know if there are any other problems!!!
